I'm a Senior Software Engineer with experience in Python, golang and historically C#.
I build infrastructure, deploy services, maintain, and eventually decommission them.

Currently I'm working for RWE Supply & Trading in London, spreading the Zen of Python
and terraforming infrastructure for internal applications. All that in line with
best gitops practices!

Peace!
