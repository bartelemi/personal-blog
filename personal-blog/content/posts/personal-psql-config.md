## Official CLI client

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is by far my most favourite relational database engine.
It's very powerful, extensible, widely adopted by cloud providers, and totally FOSS.
There are many [client tools](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients) that let you interact with Postgres,
but I usually prefer to default to official software when I have so many choices. That way, I know the tool will be compatible, and battle tested by a huge community. In case of Postgres, the official CLI tool is [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), which is usually distributed with every installation.
